# CeloChess Contract Deployment Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# NEVER commit .env files to version control!

# ============================================
# DEPLOYMENT CREDENTIALS
# ============================================
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: These are sensitive and should NEVER be committed to git!

# Deployer private key (without 0x prefix or with 0x prefix, both work)
# This is used ONLY for deployment scripts and should be kept secret

# RPC URLs for different networks

# ============================================
# OPTIONAL: Contract Verification
# ============================================
# API keys for contract verification on block explorers
# These are optional but recommended for transparency

# ============================================
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================
# 1. Use a dedicated deployment wallet with minimal funds
# 2. Never use your main wallet's private key
# 3. Rotate keys if they're ever exposed
# 4. Use hardware wallets for mainnet deployments
# 5. Store .env files securely and never commit them
# 6. Use environment variable management tools in CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Secrets)
